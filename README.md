# Advanced Programing 2 Exercise 3
In this exercise we coded a flight simulator control app.

## Usage And Features

#### Special Features ####


## Files And Directories
#### Directories
There are 3 main Directories in the project:  

#### Files
The main files are the src code files, like the FlightModel.cs, MainWindow.cs, their xaml files, and dll files (like scottPlot)

## Development
This app was developed on android studio using java.


## Installation and Running
#### Installation
Clone this git repository into a directory in your computer.  
**About FG:** If you want to use FG, you should install it, and put the "playback_small.xml" from the moodle in the folder "/data/protocols", inside the folder you installed FG in.
#### Running
If you want to run FG manually, you should to it with the next settings:
```
--generic=socket,in,10,127.0.0.1,6400,tcp,playback_small
```
(You can use different values for 127.0.0.1, 6400 for IP and port, but you should use these)
Use an IDE which supports running android projects to open the project from the directory you cloned it into earlier. Now from your IDE, run the app.  

## Design
You can see here our [UML diagram]()
#### Model, VMs and Views (MVVM)
The main architecture we use in the project is the MVVM architecture.
